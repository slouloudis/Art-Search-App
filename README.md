**Problem Domain**: There are a lack of image *focused* websites out there for saving and managing art collections, specifically in the context of not wanting to buy a painting, just searching collections as a virtual mood-board.I want to create a web application that allows users to search for artists, paintings, or other art-related data and save their favourite items to their account.

**User Stories**:

1.  As a user, I want to be able to search for an artist by name and see a list of their paintings.
2.  As a user, I want to be able to search for a painting by title and see information about the artist who created it.
3.  As a user, I want to be able to search for art-related data, such as museums or galleries, and see information about them.
4.  As a user, I want to be able to create an account and save my favourite paintings to my account.
5.  As a user, I want to be able to view my saved paintings and edit or delete them as needed.
6.  As a user, I want to be able to browse paintings by different categories, such as style, time period, or colour.
7.  As a user, I want to be able to see detailed information about a painting, such as its dimensions, medium, and location.
8. STRETCH GOALS -----------------------------
9.  As a user, I want to be able to share a painting or artist with others through social media or email.
10.  As a user, I want to be able to leave comments or reviews about a painting or artist.
11.  As a user, I want to be able to see related paintings or artists based on my search history or saved favourites.

**General Plan**
User Types in Search -> Post to my server -> Post to Artsy API -> Send back to my server -> Post relevant data to client. 
Make the website mobile responsive and pretty to look at -> Navigation should be clean, but design over the top. 
Allow user to create a profile -> Allow user to save paintings to profile -> Allow user to view saved paintings.
